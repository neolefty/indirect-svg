This project was bootstrapped with [`create-react-app --typescript`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It replicates a problem packaging SVGs.

It depends on its sister project which is published as https://www.npmjs.com/package/replicate-indirect-svg.

Running it will fail with an error:

> Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
> 
> Check the render method of `Logo`.
